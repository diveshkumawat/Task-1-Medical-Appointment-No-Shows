# Task-1-Medical-Appointment-No-Shows
I downloaded the medical appointment not show raw dataset from Kaggle. Then, I imported the .csv data in Excel and started cleaning the data, such as removing duplicate/ null values, correcting formats, replacing the short form of M/F with Male/Female, changing the scheduled day and appointment date to the local Indian standard date/time zone, and lastly changing the short form of Y/N to Yes/No in the no_show category.
